## Code of Conduct
This project, and everyone participating, in it is governed by the
[jank Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How to get support or ask questions
Overall, the [#jank Slack channel](https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C03SRH97FDK) is the
best place to ask questions to the community. If you can't/won't use Slack,
[Github Discussions](https://github.com/jank-lang/jank/discussions) is the next best place to ask.

## How to report bugs
Please use jank's Github [issue tracker](https://github.com/jank-lang/jank/issues) for reporting
bugs. Before creating a new issue, please search for an existing issue on your
topic and use that if it exists.

## Pull request process
Once you're ready to share your changes with use for review and merge
consideration, please make a pull request on Github. Add a description of your
change to your pull request, as well as a descriptive title. 

To convey that your pull request is ready for review, please add me (Jeaye Wilkerson)
as a reviewer. I will then review your pull request when I am next available.

After review, I may request iteration on your pull request. If you iterate and
you're ready for review again, please add me as a reviewer again in order to
request another review. Github emails me with every change you push, but I
cannot know which one is final. A request for review is unambiguous.

## AI-assisted contribution policy
You **MAY** use AI assistance for contributing to jank, as long as you follow
the principles described below.

### Accountability
You **MUST** take the responsibility for your contribution.

Contributing to jank means vouching for the quality, license compliance, and
utility of your submission.

All contributions, whether from a human author or assisted by large language
models (LLMs) or other generative AI tools, must meet the project’s standards
for inclusion.

The contributor is always the author and is fully accountable for the entirety
of these contributions.
	
### Transparency
You **MUST** disclose the use of AI tools when they impact a significant part of your
contribution.

You **SHOULD** disclose the other uses of AI tools, where it might be useful.

Routine use of assistive tools for correcting grammar and spelling, or for
clarifying language, does not require disclosure.

* Information about the use of AI tools will help us evaluate their impact,
  build new best practices, and adjust existing processes.
	
* Disclosures are made where authorship is normally indicated. For contributions
  tracked in git, the recommended method is an `Assisted-by:` commit message
  trailer and a note in the pull request. For other contributions, disclosure
  may include document preambles, design file metadata, translation notes, etc.
	
* Examples:
  * `Assisted-by: generic LLM chatbot`
  * `Assisted-by: ChatGPTv5`
	
### Contribution & Community Evaluation
AI tools **MAY** be used to assist human reviewers by providing analysis and
suggestions.

You **MUST NOT** use AI as the sole or final arbiter in making a substantive or
subjective judgment on a contribution, nor may it be used to evaluate a person’s
standing within the community (e.g., for funding, leadership roles, or Code of
Conduct matters).

This does not prohibit the use of automated tooling for objective technical
validation, such as CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, or spam filtering.

The final accountability for accepting a contribution, even if implemented by an
automated system, always rests with the human contributor who authorizes the
action.

Concerns about possible policy violations should be reported via
email to conduct@jank-lang.org.
	
The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, and **SHOULD** in this document
are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
