# The jank Programming Language
*by Jeaye Wilkerson, without LLMs, with feedback from the jank community.*

This book is written for jank's alpha release. It is incomplete, although its
incompleteness matches jank's. It's still early to jump into jank, but your time
and patience is welcome.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> jank is alpha quality software. It will crash. It will leak. There are huge
> areas of functionality which haven't been implemented. Your help getting us
> past this stage is greatly appreciated.
