# Reaching into C++
jank is designed to be able to reach right into C++ and access variables, types,
functions, templates, and even preprocessor values. All interop is done using
the special `cpp/` namespace.

In this chapter, we'll dive into:

1. Embedding raw C++ into your jank programs
2. Bringing native C and C++ libraries into your jank programs
3. Working with native values
