# Where to get help
The jank community, which is the Clojure community, is known to be welcoming.
You are encouraged to reach out if you have any issues. Firstly, drop into
[Slack](https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C03SRH97FDK)
and ask your questions or explain your problems there. This will often be all
that you need. However, if you'd like to report an issue for us to work on,
please create a Discussion first, on [Github](https://github.com/jank-lang/jank/discussions/new/choose).

In either case, please explain to the best of your ability and try to reproduce
any issues with the smallest amount of code possible. Most of the time, a jank
bug can be reproduced in fewer than 5 lines of code, but it can take some effort
to get there.
