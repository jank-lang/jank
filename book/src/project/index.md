# Working with projects
jank uses Leiningen to manage projects. It's possible to use other tooling, such
as Clojure CLI, but Leiningen currently provides a much better user experience.

Leiningen projects in jank manage your dependencies, compilation settings,
runtime settings, distribution settings, and more.
