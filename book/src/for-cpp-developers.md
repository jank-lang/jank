# For C++ Developers
jank is not yet ready for C++ developers. I have not stabilized the API for
embedding, there are GC concerns within existing C++ applications, the header
feeding mechanisms within Clang need additional support for multiple PCHs
(pre-compiled headers), and there is no documentation. Don't think for a minute
that this list is exhaustive.

With that said, some have already embedded jank into existing C++ applications.
If you're brave, and impatient, it can work. Otherwise, wait for me to stabilize
the Clojure side of things first. The timeline for this is more like the end of 2026.
