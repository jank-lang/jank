/* We use cpptrace to wrap our try/catch blocks so that we
 * can get stack traces from arbitrary exceptions. For how
 * this works, see here: https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works
 *
 * However, jank still has several different exception types
 * which can be thrown. Each time we want to catch them, we need
 * to enumerate all types. This becomes error-prone, since we
 * could easily miss a type in a few places and that may lead
 * to compiler panics in an otherwise totally OK error. So, since
 * we're wrapping try/catch in macros already, might as well
 * remove the redundancy with another layer.
 *
 * The primary usage of this is just to use `JANK_TRY` and then
 * combine that with `JANK_CATCH(jank::util::print_exception)`.
 * However, you can specify any function you want there; it just
 * needs to have all of the correct overloads. You'll know if it
 * doesn't. The `JANK_CATCH_THEN` is a generalization of this
 * which also takes some arbitrary code to then after handling
 * the exception. We can use this to early return, for example.
 *
 * One implication of this design is that we can provide a single
 * function to handle all expected exception types, with full type
 * info. For example: `JANK_CATCH([&](auto const &e){  })` */
