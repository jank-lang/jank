; This test suite finds `input.jank` files, each in their own directory,
; and runs them. They're all expected to fail and the stdout is captured
; and compared to an `output.txt` file in the same directory. The output must
; match, or the test fails. If a `setup` script exists in the directory,
; it will be called prior to loading `input.jank`.
;
; This sript can be executed with either `test` or `generate` as a parameter.
;
; Providing `test` will invoke all `input.jank` files and ensure their output
; matches their `output.txt` files.
;
; Providing `generate` will invoke all `input.jank` files and will update the
; corresponding `output.txt` file with the output. This allows for batch regeneration
; of output, but the changes must be reviewed carefully.
