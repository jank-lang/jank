   in preference to calling this directly.

   Libs

   A 'lib' is a named set of resources in module path whose contents define a
   library of Clojure code. Lib names are symbols and each lib is associated
   with a Clojure namespace and a Java package that share its name. A lib's
   name also locates its root directory within module path using Java's
   package name to module path-relative path mapping. All resources in a lib
   should be contained in the directory structure under its root directory.
   All definitions a lib makes should be in its associated namespace.

   'require loads a lib by loading its root resource. The root resource path
   is derived from the lib name in the following manner:
   Consider a lib named by the symbol 'x.y.z; it has the root directory
   <module path>/x/y/, and its root resource is <module path>/x/y/z.clj, or
   <module path>/x/y/z.cljc if <module path>/x/y/z.clj does not exist. The
   root resource should contain code to create the lib's
   namespace (usually by using the ns macro) and load any additional
   lib resources.

   Libspecs

   A libspec is a lib name or a vector containing a lib name followed by
   options expressed as sequential keywords and arguments.

   Recognized options:
   :as takes a symbol as its argument and makes that symbol an alias to the
   lib's namespace in the current namespace.
   :as-alias takes a symbol as its argument and aliases like :as, however
   the lib will not be loaded. If the lib has not been loaded, a new
   empty namespace will be created (as with create-ns).
   :refer takes a list of symbols to refer from the namespace or the :all
   keyword to bring in all public vars.

   Prefix Lists

   It's common for Clojure code to depend on several libs whose names have
   the same prefix. When specifying libs, prefix lists can be used to reduce
   repetition. A prefix list contains the shared prefix followed by libspecs
   with the shared prefix removed from the lib names. After removing the
   prefix, the names that remain must not contain any periods.

   Flags

   A flag is a keyword.
   Recognized flags: :reload, :reload-all, :verbose
   :reload forces loading of all the identified libs even if they are
   already loaded (has no effect on libspecs using :as-alias)
   :reload-all implies :reload and also forces loading of all libs that the
   identified libs directly or indirectly load via require or use
   (has no effect on libspecs using :as-alias)
   :verbose triggers printing information about each load, alias, and refer

   Example:

   The following would load the libraries clojure.zip and clojure.set
   abbreviated as 's'.
